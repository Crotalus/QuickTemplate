QuickTemplate
-------------
Mod that helps with building templates. 

Activates by middle mouse button (or Ctrl-key)

Example:

You create a t1 pd template with 9 walls surrounding it and set the PD as the icon of the template.

When have a T1 PD selected for building you just press middle mouse button and it will automatically transform into the PD-template. You could also middle click an existing pd and it will 
change into the template.

If you have several templates with the same icon you cycle through them by repeatedly pressing middle mouse button.

Another good use is to have mass storages template with a t2 mex in the center/icon, then you can middle click a t2 mex to get the mass storage template.
